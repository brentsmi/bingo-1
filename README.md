Stackato Bingo
==============

So you're in a Stackato demo and you're bored. It's a real problem not to fall asleep. Thanks to this little HTML5 (JQuery Mobile powered) web app, we have a solution for you.

A way to keep you listening somehow.

All you need is your phone and a couple of co-attendees to share the fun with you and of course a Stackato demo with an organizer. Obviously the organizer shouldn't be informed he is the main actor of the game. Try to keep it quiet. At least at the beginning...

You all start the app together as the demo starts. Each of you will have an ramdomly fed card which contains 5x5 grid filled with keywords. As the organizer (you could also extend to all non-informed attendees) pronounces a keyword, check it in. You win with either a full row or a full colunm in your grid. BUT, you've got to be the first and can't forget to stand up and yell STACKATO!, otherwise your win will be invalidated.

Easy peasy?

Go ahead! Don't be shy, give it a trial.
