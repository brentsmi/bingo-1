Stackato Bingo!
==============

So you're attending a Stackato demo and you're learning all about PaaS. What better way to witness the power of Stackato than by playing bingo on Stackato with your fellow attendees? Check out this little multi-player HTML5 (JQuery Mobile powered) web app.

All you need is your phone and a couple of co-demo-watchers to share the fun with you. You probably don't want to let the demo presenter know you're playing so try to keep it quiet. At least at the beginning...

You all start the app together as the demo starts. Each of you will have a ramdomly fed card which contains a 5x5 grid filled with keywords. As the organizer says a keyword, click on it to highlight. Just like regular bingo, you win with either a full row or a full colunm in your grid. BUT, you've got to be the first and can't forget to stand up and yell <b>STACKATO BINGO!</b>, otherwise your win will be invalidated.

Go forth and check it out!
