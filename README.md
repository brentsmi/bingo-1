Bullshit Bingo
==============

So you're in a meeting and you're bored. It's a real problem not to fall asleep. Thanks to this little HTML5 (JQuery Mobile powered) web apps, we find a solution for you.

A way to keep you listening somehow.

All you need is you phone and a couple of co-workers to share the fun with you and of course a (boring) meeting with a chairman. Obviously the chairman shouldn't be informed he is the main actor of the game. Try to keep it quite. At least at the beginning...

You all start the app together as the meetings starts. Each of you will have an ramdomly fed card which contains 5x5 grid filled with keywords. As the chairman (you could also extend to all non-informed attendees) pronounces a keyword, check it in. You win with either a full raw or a full colunm in your grid. BUT, you've got to be the first and not to forget to stand up and yell BULLSHIT!, otherwise your win will be invalidated.

Easy peasy? 
Go! Don't be shy, give it a trial.
